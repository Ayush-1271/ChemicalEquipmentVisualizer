# Design Critique: History / Recent Uploads

## 1. Interaction & Feedback
*   **"View Dashboard" Button**:
    *   **Status**: It handles `stopPropagation`, so it works.
    *   **Issue**: It uses a standard blue button style. It should be the *primary* action, maybe with a "Play" or "Chart" icon to signify analysis.
*   **"Refresh" Button**:
    *   **Status**: Plain text button.
    *   **Improvement**: Needs a loading state (spinner) during the fetch to give feedback.

## 2. Visual Hierarchy & Aesthetic
*   **Cards**:
    *   **Current**: Basic flex/grid cards with transparency.
    *   **Critique**: They look a bit "admin panel".
    *   **Recommendation**:
        *   Add a **Status Badge** (e.g., "Processed", "Ready").
        *   Make the "Date" more prominent (e.g., "Today", "Yesterday") using `timeAgo`.
        *   Use a **List View** option for high density? (Stick to Grid for now as it's friendlier).

## 3. Data Visibility
*   **Pagination**:
    *   **Current**: Fetches `api.getHistory()` which defaults to 50 items (per my backend change).
    *   **Issue**: The UI title says "Recent Uploads ({history.length})". If there are >50, the user won't know they are missing some.
    *   **Fix**: Update title to "Recent Uploads (Showing last {history.length})".

## 4. Redesign Plan
1.  **Header**: Add "ChemicalViz **History**" branding.
2.  **Card Layout**:
    *   Top: Filename + ID (small).
    *   Middle: Stat (Record Count) + Date.
    *   Bottom: "Open Dashboard" (Primary) + "PDF Report" (Secondary/Icon).
3.  **Empty State**: enhance with an "Upload Now" button routing to the Upload tab.
