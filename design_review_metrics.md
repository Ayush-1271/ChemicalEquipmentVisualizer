# Metric Visualizations Review: ChemicalViz Pro

## 1. Metric Distributions (With Median)
**Current State**: Scatter (Strip) Plot with Vertical Median Bar.

### Usefulness Analysis
*   **Pros**:
    *   **Quick Scan**: Engineers can instantly see the range (min/max) and central tendency (median).
    *   **Outlier Detection**: Extreme points are immediately visible as detached from the cluster.
    *   **Data Density**: Efficient usage of vertical screen space (for ~15 points).
*   **Cons**:
    *   **Identity Loss**: The dots are anonymous. Hovering is required to find *which* equipment is the outlier.
    *   **Context Gap**: "High Flow" is shown, but does it correlate with High Pressure? This chart doesn't say.
*   **Verdict**: **RETAIN BUT REFINE**. It answers "Is the system stable?" well. It fails at "Which unit is unstable?".
*   **Recommendation**:
    *   **Add Box Plot Overlay**: A faint box plot would formalize the statistical distribution (IQR).
    *   **Link Hover State**: Hovering a dot in the Distribution chart should ideally highlight the corresponding bubble in the main Scatter Chart.

## 2. Correlation Matrix (Heatmap)
**Current State**: 3x3 Grid showing Pearson correlation coefficients.

### Usefulness Analysis
*   **Pros**:
    *   **Precision**: Gives an exact number (e.g., `0.77`) for relationships.
    *   **Scientific Validity**: Engineers trust raw numbers over visual estimates.
*   **Cons**:
    *   **Low Information Density**: The grid consumes significant screen real estate to display only **3 unique values** ($r_{Flow,Press}, r_{Flow,Temp}, r_{Press,Temp}$).
    *   **Visual Redundancy**: The relationship between Flow/Pressure is *already visible* in the Bubble Chart.
    *   **Inefficient Space**: A 3x3 grid for 3 variables is mathematically sparse (diagonal is trivial, lower triangle is mirror).
*   **Verdict**: **REMOVE & REPLACE**. The screen space cost outweighs the value of 3 numbers.
*   **Recommendation**:
    *   **Replace with Parallel Coordinates Plot**:
        *   **Concept**: Plot each equipment as a line crossing 3 vertical axes (Flow, Pressure, Temp).
        *   **Value**: This visualizes *both* the **Distribution** (spread on axis) and the **Correlation** (lines crossing or parallel).
        *   **Bonus**: It explicitly identifies *which* equipment has the high/low values, solving the "Identity Loss" problem of the current distribution plots.
    *   **Implementation Note**: Normalize values (0-100%) for the plot, but show real units in tooltips.

## Summary of Action Plan
1.  **Delete Correlation Matrix Component**.
2.  **Implement Parallel Coordinates Chart** in its place (or merging with Distributions).
    *   *Why*: Fits the "High Tech / Pro" aesthetic perfectly (looks like a sophisticated HUD).
    *   *Benefit*: Shows multidimensional outliers instantly (e.g., "High Flow line crosses to Low Pressure axis").
